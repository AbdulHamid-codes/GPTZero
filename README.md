# GPTZero

GPTZero is an AI model with some mathematical hacks to determine if a piece of sentence fed to it is written by ChatGPT or a human being.

## The motivation for it

Recently, GPTZero got a lot of hype/traction from media to be able to determine whether a set of sentences are generated from ChatGPT. But since the implementation is closed-source, we tried to replicate what they are doing by open-sourcing the model and the weights.
